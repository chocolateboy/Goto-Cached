Goto-Cached version 0.22
========================

Goto::Cached - a fast drop-in replacement for Perl's O(n) goto

Goto::Cached provides a fast, lexically-scoped drop-in replacement for Perl's
builtin "goto". Its use is the same as the builtin. "goto &sub" and jumps out
of the current scope (including "if" and "unless" blocks) are not cached.
